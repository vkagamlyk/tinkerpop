*NOT OFFICIALLY NAMED YET*

== TinkerPop 3.7.0

*Release Date: NOT OFFICIALLY RELEASED YET*

Please see the link:https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/blob/3.7.0/CHANGELOG.asciidoc#release-3-7-0[changelog] for a complete list of all the modifications that are part of this release.

=== Upgrading for Users

==== Gremlin.NET: Nullable Annotations

Gremlin.NET now uses link:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/nullable-references#nullable-variable-annotations[nullable annotations]
to state wether an argument or a return value can be null or not. This should make it much less likely to get a
`NullReferenceException` from Gremlin.NET.

This change required to make some breaking changes but most users should not be affected by this as the breaking
changes are limited to APIs that are mostly intended for graph driver providers.

See: link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TINKERPOP-2348[TINKERPOP-2348]

==== Removed connectOnStartup javascript

Removed the `connectOnStartup` option for Gremlin Javascript API to resolve potential `unhandledRejection` and race
conditions. New `DriverRemoteConnection` objects no longer initiate connection by default at startup. Call `open()`
explicitly if one wishes to manually connect on startup.

For example:

[source,javascript]
----
const drc = new DriverRemoteConnection(url);
drc.open().catch(err => {
   // Handle error upon open.
})
----

==== Creation of New `gremlin-util` Module

`gremlin-driver` has been refactored and several classes have been extracted to a new `gremlin-util` module. Any classes
which are utilized by both `gremlin-driver` and `gremlin-server` have been extracted to `gremlin-util`. This includes
the entire `tinkerpop.gremlin.driver.ser` and `tinkerpop.gremlin.driver.message` packages as well as
`tinkerpop.gremlin.driver.MessageSerializer` and `tinkerpop.gremlin.driver.Tokens`. For a full list of the migrated
classes, see: link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TINKERPOP-2819[TINKERPOP-2819].
All migrated classes have had their packages updated to reflect this change. For these classes, packages have changed
from `tinkerpop.gremlin.driver.*` to `tinkerpop.gremlin.util.*`. For example
`org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.driver.ser.GraphBinaryMessageSerializerV1` has been updated to
`org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.util.ser.GraphBinaryMessageSerializerV1`. All imports of these classes should be updated
to reflect this change. All server config files which declare a list of serializers should also be updated to
reflect the new location of serializer classes.

See: link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TINKERPOP-2819[TINKERPOP-2819]

==== Removal of `gremlin-driver` from `gremlin-server`

`gremlin-driver` is no longer a dependency of `gremlin-server` and thus will no longer be packaged in server
distributions. Any app which makes use of both `gremlin-driver` and `gremlin-server` will now need to directly
include both modules.

=== Upgrading for Providers

==== Graph Driver Providers

===== Gremlin.NET: Nullable Reference Types

Enabling nullable reference types comes with some breaking changes in Gremlin.NET which can affect driver providers.

GraphBinary APIs changed to make better use of nullable reference types. Instead of one method `WriteValueAsync` and
one method `ReadValueAsync`, there are now methods `WriteNullableValueAsync` and `ReadNullableValueAsync` that allow
`null` values and methods `WriteNonNullableValueAsync` and `ReadNonNullableValueAsync` that do not allow `null` values.

Some `set` property accessors were removed from some pure data classes in the `Structure` and the `Driver.Messages`
namespaces to initialize these properties directly from the constructor which ensures that they are really not `null`.
We also used this opportunity to convert some of these pure data classes into a `record`.

See: link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TINKERPOP-2348[TINKERPOP-2348]

===== Reworked Gremlin Socket Server

The `SimpleSocketServer` from `gremlin-driver` has been brought into a new module `gremlin-tools/gremlin-socket-server`
and it has been adapted to be usable by all drivers for testing. See more about creating gremlin socket server tests
link:https://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/x.y.z/dev/developer/#gremlin-socket-server-tests[here].
